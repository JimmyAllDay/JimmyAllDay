I am an aspiring Javascript developer, currently transitioning into web development as a full-time career. I am continuing to learn and study Javascript through a variety of modalities, including through self-directed study, and formal coursework. In May of 2021, I completed a front end development <i>Nano-Degree</i> qualification through Udacity. Projects I worked on during this certificate used a range of technologies within the javascript ecosystem, including HTML, Javascript, CSS, Sass, Node, Express, and Webpack, among others. As at September 2021, I am undertaking a further nano-degree qualification in React, which includes project work using Redux. Concerning prospective web development roles, I am interested primarily in positions where I can apply my work ethic and enthusiasm for learning, and where I can contribute my own unique perspective as part of a team of supportive, like-minded people.
