I am currently transitioning to a career in web development. Prospective employers will see from my GitHub repository that I possess foundational programming skills in HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node, React and Webpack. In May of 2021, I completed a Front End Developer Nano-Degree qualification through Udacity. As at September 2021, I am undertaking a further nano-degree qualification in React, which involves training in Redux. I am attracted to roles where I will help realise an entrepreneurial vision, such as roles within innovative or start-up companies. Sustained by a sincere passion for web development, I often work on projects late into the night. Employers will maximise my value by placing me in roles where I can harness this work ethic while learning from more experienced developers.
